			 My interest in design and producing something of my own grew as I learnt to draw at a young age. As I began to expand my knowledge about what different mediums I could eplore and different techniques that I could apply, I knew I wanted to be an artist. I grew up in a small country town and attented highschool in Geelong where I discovered the adobe suite. It was lifechanging, the idea of taking my photographs or drawings and then developing them in ways I've only dreamed was incredible. I now currently reside in Ballarat and am now in my second year as a Graphic Design student at Federation University and I have never being so sure that this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. Since then I have explored subjects such as typography, packaging, illustration, animation, design, photography and web design. 

			 A lot of my portfolio consists of projects for my course however I have done a few personal logo designs outside of my studies and am happy to do more upon request, simply visit the contact page to send me an enquiry.
